#this is in progress....
<p>Hello üëã I‚Äôm <strong>Audrey Weaver</strong>, and I am completing my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong> with a concentration in <strong>Data Analytics</strong>. Over the course of this program, I have developed both the technical depth and professional confidence to design, build, troubleshoot, and deliver impactful software solutions.</p>

<p>This ePortfolio, which features my custom capstone project <a href="https://mymessiertracker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>My Messier Tracker</strong></a>, demonstrates my ability to apply computer science principles to solve meaningful problems through full-stack development, database engineering, and data visualization. Early coursework in algorithms and data structures strengthened my logical problem-solving foundation, while later courses emphasized secure, modular software and well-documented database design.</p>

<p>The <em>My Messier Tracker</em> project is a culmination of these skills. It is a full-stack web application that allows users to track, document, and analyze their astrophotography progress across the Messier catalog. The project integrates a PostgreSQL database, Flask back end, and interactive front end featuring real user data and visualizations. Through this process, I demonstrated proficiency in software engineering, database optimization, user authentication, and security design.</p>

<p>Collaboration and communication have been central to my success in this program. I have worked in agile-style environments, managed code versions through Git and GitHub, and practiced clear documentation through peer reviews and project artifacts. These experiences have prepared me to thrive in dynamic, cross-functional teams and to communicate technical insights effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.</p>

<p>My ePortfolio showcases three major enhancements representing the core areas of computer science: <strong>software engineering</strong>, <strong>algorithms and data structures</strong>, and <strong>databases</strong>. Collectively, these artifacts demonstrate my ability to turn well-designed ideas into production-ready applications that deliver value. As I enter the next stage of my career, I bring a passion for data-driven problem solving, continuous learning, and building solutions that balance innovation with security and performance.</p>


#### What is MyMessierTracker?
MyMessierTracker is a full-stack Flask + PostgreSQL web app that lets you catalog your Messier captures, upload a photo, tag the object, add notes, and track progress across all 110 objects with clean analytics and visuals. It also includes real catalog data (object types, RA/Dec location, magnitude) with rarity scores and progress metrics. It aims to help users track and journal their Messier-object observations while inspiring astrophotographers to continue gazing upward and capturing the wonders of the night sky.

## Program-wide self-assessment
* Collaborating in a team environment: Used feature branches (enh1/2/3 ‚Üí dev ‚Üí main), performed merges with conflict resolution, and documented changes for review, these are all habits that translate directly into a real-world team workflows.
* Communicating with stakeholders: Explain requirements and trade-offs in a way that both technical and non-technical audiences can follow (examples: why a normalized schema + views are more efficient than ad-hoc queries, why secure uploads matter and practiced maintaining concise READMEs and other documentation).
* Data structures & algorithms: Applied indexing strategies, window functions, choosing the best algorithm for the need and implementing efficient server-side computations to keep UIs snappy and real-time metrics accurate at scale.
* Software engineering & database: Produced an easily maintainable Flask codebase, reproducible Postgres database structure with easilly seedable SQL, modularized code with a  templated UI - demonstrating full-stack competency.
* Security mindset: Practiced a security mindset throughout the entire process with strongly hashed credentials, validated inputs, safe file paths, secret management and considered abuse cases such as path traversal, and CSRF (cross-site request forgery) through requiring the users passwords at destructive action requests even thorugh authentication during the current session is already active.

### How the artifact enhancements fit together
  I chose to develop and enhance a singluar project to show how these topics all fit together in a project as a whole.
  
  * Authentication & Accounts (Enhancement 1): Secure login/registration establishes identity and protects user data.
  * Analytics & Rarity Metrics (Enhancement 2): SQL views and calculated fields power charts/insights visible in the dashboard.
  * Edit/Delete & Journal UX (Enhancement 3): Robust CRUD with safe image handling and consistent UI patterns completes the end-to-end user workflow.
  * Together they illustrate a coherent product: secure users, trustworthy data, and a polished interface deployed like real software.

## Enhancement Narratives

### Software Design and Engineering: Implementing Account Deletion Functionality
<p>I implemented a secure ‚ÄúDelete My Account‚Äù flow that permanently removes a user and all related data, aligning the app with privacy best practices (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Erasure</a>) while keeping the codebase lean and maintainable.</p>

- A user can choose to delete account data from their profile menu.
<p align="center">
  <img width="319" height="251" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60925572-0c4a-4f4f-a259-751058d9a64c" />
</p>

- Here they will be given a clear warning that this action is final and irreversible. A password is required to confirm this decision.

</p>

- Once they enter their password then all data is deleted in proper order through a cascading SQL structure that also collects all files stored and later deletes those files as well once the database records are removed.

```python
# DELETE ACCOUNT PAGE VIEW -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@app.route("/account/delete", methods=["POST"])
@login_required
def account_delete():
    # pulled from delete modal password input
    pwd = request.form.get("delete_acct_password", "")
    user_id = str(current_user.id)

    # open db connection
    conn = get_db_conn()
    # placeholder for files to collect then delete
    file_paths = []
    try:
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            # Verify password
            cur.execute("""SELECT password_hash 
                        FROM public.users WHERE id = %s""", (user_id,))
            row = cur.fetchone()
            # bad password
            if not row or not row[0] or not bcrypt.check_password_hash(row[0], pwd):
                flash("Incorrect password. Please try again.", "danger")
                session['del_error'] = "Incorrect password. Please try again"
                return redirect(url_for("dashboard", del_error=1))

            # pass userid & get image paths before deleting from table so they can be removed later
            cur.execute("SELECT file_path FROM public.images WHERE user_id = %s", (user_id,))
            img_files = [r[0] for r in cur.fetchall()]

            # delete all user data via cascades generated at schema creation, this setup properly 
            # manages the removal of records from journal_entries, user_object_images, images tables
            cur.execute("DELETE FROM public.users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))

        # commits changes to db
        conn.commit()
        
    # if process failed, let user know and send back to dashboard page and close db connection    
    except Exception:
        if conn: conn.rollback()
        # error then shown in the delete modal setup in index.html
        return redirect(url_for("dashboard"))
    finally:
        if conn:
            conn.close()

    # then remove actual image files from storage
    for img in img_files:
        try:
            # updated to be platform agnositic for web service deployment
            # TODO: VALIDATE
            p = (UPLOAD_DIR / img)
            if p.exists():
                p.unlink()
        except Exception:
            app.logger.exception("Failed to delete file %s", img)

    # send user to the 'success' screen and logout
    logout_user()
    return render_template("post_delete.html")
  ```
    
- The completion of this process is confirmed to the user once complete.
