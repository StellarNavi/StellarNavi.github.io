## Personal Self-Assessment
Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Audrey and I am wrapping up my bachelors of science in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Analytics. I'm happy to share my custom, full-stack web application titled <a href="https://www.mymessiertracker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My Messier Tracker</a> as proof of my skills in the field of computer science. 

### Program-wide self-assessment

Collaborating in a team environment: Used feature branches (enh1/2/3 â†’ dev â†’ main), performed merges with conflict resolution, and documented changes for reviewâ€”habits that translate directly to team workflows.

Communicating with stakeholders: Explain requirements and trade-offs in non-jargon terms (e.g., why a normalized schema + views beats ad-hoc queries; why secure uploads matter) and maintain concise READMEs/runbooks.

Data structures & algorithms: Applied indexing strategies, window functions, and efficient server-side computations to keep UI snappy and metrics correct at scale.

Software engineering & database: Produced a maintainable Flask codebase, reproducible Docker setup, migration/seed SQL, and templated UIâ€”demonstrating full-stack competency.

Security mindset: Practiced defense-in-depth (hashed credentials, validated inputs, safe file paths, secret management) and considered abuse cases (path traversal, CSRF, weak passwords).

### How the artifact enhancements fit together

Authentication & Accounts (Enhancement 1): Secure login/registration establishes identity and protects user data.

Analytics & Rarity Metrics (Enhancement 2): SQL views and calculated fields power charts/insights visible in the dashboard.

Edit/Delete & Journal UX (Enhancement 3): Robust CRUD with safe image handling and consistent UI patterns completes the end-to-end user workflow.
Together they illustrate a coherent product: secure users, trustworthy data, and a polished interface deployed like real software.

## Enhancement Narratives

### The artifact used for all three enhancements that I will discuss here was my custom full-stack web application - 'My Messier Tracker'
